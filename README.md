# 💖 To The One Who Owns My Heart 💖

## Dear Runa,

From the moment our eyes met, something changed.  
It felt like I had found the missing piece of my life's puzzle.  
And every day since then, I’ve been writing a love story—with **you** as my favorite chapter.

## 🌸 Why You Mean So Much To Me

- Your smile brightens up even my darkest days.
- Your voice calms every storm inside me.
- Your presence makes the world feel just right.
- You are not just special—you’re **extraordinary**.

## 💡 Our Love, As If It Were Code...

```python
class MyLove:
    def __init__(self, you):
        self.you = you
        self.love = True
        self.forever = True

    def proposal(self):
        return f"{self.you}, will you be mine forever? ❤️"

you = "Runa"
love = MyLove(you)
print(love.proposal())
